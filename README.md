# Some Object-Oriented Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects that demonstrate the implementation of various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. Each project focuses on creating a different system, from simple simulations to practical applications, utilizing OOP principles such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
